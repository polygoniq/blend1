## About

> <img align="right" src="docs/images/gdfs_uploads.png" title="Google Drive uploading" width="20%">
>
> The inbuilt backup mechanism in [Blender](https://blender.org) saves `.blend1`, `.blend2`, ...
> files next to the original. If you are using Google Drive, OneDrive, Samba, NFS or other cloud
> or remote mounted filesystem, this can be very wasteful. You will end up uploading `.blend1` as
> well as the original when you hit `CTRL+S`. If you use more than 1 backup version you will end
> up with a ton of uploads every time you save your project!
>
> At [polygoniq](https://polygoniq.com) we use [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) for
> all our customer projects. And even though we have a very fast internet connection we ended up
> saturating it with all the backup uploads. That's why we decided to create this addon.
> We have only the main .blend stored on Google Drive while we save backups locally.
> That way backups are available in case something goes wrong and at the same time uploads
> are fast and collaborating on large blends over Google Drive is possible.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> You need [Blender 3.3 LTS or higher](https://blender.org). Windows, macOS 10 and Linux are
> supported.

### Installation

#### Blender 4.2 or newer
Visit [polygoniq extensions repository](https://extensions.polygoniq.com), where we explain
how to set it up as remote repository so you can install and update everything from Blender.


#### Blender 4.1 or older
##### Download the ZIP
|                          Stable Release                                                  |                         Unstable Master Branch                   |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/polygoniq/blend1/releases) for a stable ZIP.  | Click `Code` -> `Download ZIP` if you are feeling adventurous.   |

##### Install ZIP in Blender

Go to `Edit` -> `Preferences`. And select `Add-ons` in the left bar. Click the `Install...` button
in the top section. Select the ZIP file you just downloaded and click `Install Add-on`. After the
installation finishes, check the checkbox next to the `blend1` addon.

#### Updating

The addon can auto-update itself to latest stable or even unstable master version. Head over to
`Edit` -> `Preferences` and select `Add-ons` in the left bar. Type `blend1` into the search bar
and then expand the addon section of `blend1`. Scroll down to the auto update section to set up
update intervals or even update manually.

## Usage

> Set up the `Save versions` to the desired number of backups of your work. Work in Blender as
> usual. If you need to recall a backup, open the `N` menu and look for the `blend1` panel. Use
> the `Recall` operator to recall a backup.
